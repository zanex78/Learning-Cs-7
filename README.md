# Learning7 C# (final)
This is the sixth repository of me learning the basics of C#. Im currently learning from a (in my oppinion) very good youtube tutorial series. This series of learning C# will have 7 repositories since there are only 7 Episodes. In every new repository of mine there will be the youtube link of the current used repository.
